## 0.1

### In this version

- cabal to 2020-05-02T10:11:15Z
- stack-8.8.3 to lts-15.10
- stack to nightly-2020-05-01

### Changes

This is the initial version, so too many to list individually.

The key point is that is now supports multi-component cradles, and has been in
daily use by the developers for some time.

It still does not have feature parity with `haskell-ide-engine`, but it is
currently useful.
